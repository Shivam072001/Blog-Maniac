## Question - {#Question}

You are given a list of bombs. The range of a bomb is defined as the area where its effect can be felt. This area is in the shape of a circle with the center as the location of the bomb.

The bombs are represented by a 0-indexed 2D integer array bombs where bombs[i] = [xi, yi, ri]. xi and yi denote the X-coordinate and Y-coordinate of the location of the ith bomb, whereas ri denotes the radius of its range.

You may choose to detonate a single bomb. When a bomb is detonated, it will detonate all bombs that lie in its range. These bombs will further detonate the bombs that lie in their ranges.

***Given the list of bombs, return the maximum number of bombs that can be detonated if you are allowed to detonate only one bomb.***

##### Examples - {#Examples}
1. ![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/11/06/desmos-eg-3.png)
>**Input**: bombs = [[1,1,5],[10,10,5]]\
**Output**: 1\
**Explanation**: Detonating either bomb will not detonate the other bomb, so the maximum number of bombs that can be detonated is 1.

2. ![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/11/06/desmos-eg-2.png)
>**Input**: bombs = [[1,2,3],[2,3,1],[3,4,2],[4,5,3],[5,6,4]]\
**Output**: 5\
**Explanation**: 
The best bomb to detonate is bomb 0 because:
> - Bomb 0 detonates bombs 1 and 2. The red circle denotes the range of bomb 0.
> - Bomb 2 detonates bomb 3. The blue circle denotes the range of bomb 2.
> - Bomb 3 detonates bomb 4. The green circle denotes the range of bomb 3.
Thus all 5 bombs are detonated.
